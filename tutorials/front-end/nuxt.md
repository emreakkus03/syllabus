## What is Nuxt?
Nuxt is a free and open-source framework that provides an intuitive way to create full-stack web applications and websites using Vue.js.
You can start writing .vue files right away, with server-side rendering by default.
Nuxt also has no vendor lock-ins, allowing applications to be deployed anywhere.  

Nuxt uses conventions, automation and a directory structure to automate repetitive tasks:

1. With file-based routing, **you define routes based on the structure of the directory**. This makes your application easier to organize and eliminates the need to manually configure routes.
2. Nuxt automatically **breaks code into smaller chunks**, which can reduce application load time.
3. If you write Vue components in their respective directories, you can **use them without having to import them**, due to tree-shaking.


What else is good to know about Nuxt? The framework uses the **server engine Nitro**. This is useful because in production this engine builds the output in 1 directory and the application minimized. A Nuxt application **can also be deployed to a Node server**, rendered to be hosted in static environments or deployed to serverless and edge providers. Finally, you can extend Nuxt with custom features and integrations with **third-party services**.
