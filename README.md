## Development
To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run docs:dev
```

If you want to customize the theme using Tailwind CSS, run the following command in a separate terminal while the development server is running:

```bash
npm run tailwind:watch
```

This will watch for changes and update the CSS accordingly.
