# Astro: The New Player on the Block

In the ever-changing technical world of developers, there is a constant search for newer, faster, and more efficient ways to build websites. One newcomer that is gaining more and more attention is AstroJS. A fast web framework for content-driven websites, where is't especially build for content-rich sites where performance matters most.

In this article, I will dive deeper into what Astro is, what sets it apart from other frameworks, how to set it up, and share my experience of using AstroJS in a proof of concept.


## What is AstroJS?

Astro is a **static site generator (SSG)** but with a twist. Astro renders as much as possible on the server and only sends JavaScript if needed. This means that the pages that are send to the client mostly only consists pure HTML, which makes the loading time very fast.

Astro is a fully featured framework with everything you need to build a modern website.

1. ### Content Collections
   AstroJS comes with built-in support for content collections, making it very easy to work with organized groups of content. This feature is especially useful for generating lists of blog posts or similar content types quickly and efficiently, with minimal coding effort. 

    In practice this looks like this:

    ```
    src/content/
    â”œâ”€â”€ /blogs          // The blog collection
    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ week-1.md  // A collection entry
    â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ week-2.md  // A collection entry 
    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ week-3.md  // A collection entry
    ```

    If you folders are set, you can now start querying your content using their build in content APIs.

    AstroJS provides two functions to query data collections. One to query all the articles of a collection `getCollection()` and the other to query one item that is equal to the given name `getEntry()`.

    ```js
      import { getCollection, getEntry } from 'astro:content';

      // â€”â€” Get all entries from a collection. â€”â€”
      // Requires the name of the collection as an argument.
      // Example: retrieve `src/content/blogs/**`
      const allBlogPosts = await getCollection('blogs');

      // â€”â€” Get a single entry from a collection. â€”â€”
      // Requires the name of the collection and either
      // the entry `slug` (content collections) or `id` (data collections)
      // Example: retrieve `src/content/blogs/week-1.json`
      const graceHopperProfile = await getEntry('blogs', 'week-1');
    ```

<br>

2. ### Components
   Astro components are like the LegoÂ® blocks of a Astro project. Astro components are like components in other frameworks like React of NextJS. They consist of a small or larger piece of HTML that can â€” if wanted â€” be mofified with params. In Astro these params are called *props*. Astro components are recognizable by the file extension `.astro`.

    If you've ever written in Markdown before, you probably are already be familiar with the concept of frontmatter. In AstroJS they started with a similar concept but uses the lines between the `---` to write JavaScript to write any code that you need to render your template.

    ::: code-group
    ```astro [src/components/some-component.astro]
    ---
    import SomeAstroComponent from '../components/SomeAstroComponent.astro';
    import SomeReactComponent from '../components/SomeReactComponent.jsx';
    import someData from '../data/blogs.json';

    // Access passed-in component props, like `<X title="Hello, World" />`
    const { title } = Astro.props;
    // Fetch external data, even from a private API or database
    const data = await fetch('SOME_SECRET_API_URL/users').then(r => r.json());

    const name = 'Astro';
    ---

    <!-- Your template here! -->
    <div id="content-wrapper">

      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

      <!-- Use props and other variables from the component script: -->
      <p>{title}</p>

      <!-- Usage of consts -->
      <h1>{name}</h1>

      <!-- Children -->
      <div>
        <slot name="after-header" />  <!--  children with the `slot="after-header"` attribute will go here -->

        <slot />  <!--  children without a `slot`, or with `slot="default"` attribute will go here -->

        <slot name="after-footer" /> <!--  children with the `slot="after-footer"` attribute will go here -->
      </div>

      <!-- Children with fallback content -->
      <slot>
        <p>This is my fallback content, if there is no child passed into slot</p>
      </slot>

    </div>
    ```
    :::

    As demonstrated in the example above, Astro components offer a range of flexible features:

    1. **Plain HTML**: Simple HTML markup can be used directly in your component.
    2. **HTML with props**: You can dynamically insert data using props passed into the component, allowing customization and reusability.
    3. **Children and named slots**: Use slots to insert content into specific parts of the component. Named slots give you more control over where each piece of content appears.
    4. **Fallback content for slots**: If no child content is provided for a slot, you can define fallback content to be displayed by default.

<br>

3. ### Middleware
   Just like in other frameworks, in AstroJS middleware allows you to intercept requests and responses and modify or add data. 

   Middleware also allows you to set and share request-specific information across endpoints and pages by mutating a `locals` object that is available in all Astro components and API endpoints. 

   #### Usage
   ::: code-group
   ```js [src/middleware.js]
    export function onRequest (context, next) {
      // intercept data from a request
      // optionally, modify the properties in `locals`
      context.locals.user.name = "John Wick";
      context.locals.welcomeTitle = () => {
          return "Welcome back " + locals.user.name;
      };

      // return a Response or the result of calling `next()`
      return next();
    };

   ```
   :::

   Then you can use this information inside any .astro file with Astro.locals.

   ::: code-group
   ```astro [src/pages/orders.astro]
    ---
    const title = Astro.locals.welcomeTitle();
    const orders = Array.from(Astro.locals.orders.entries());
    ---
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>This {data.property} is from middleware.</p>
    <ul>
        {orders.map(order => {
            return <li>{/* do something with each order */}</li>;
        })}
    </ul>
   ```
   :::

   In case that you want to chain multiple middlewares, in AstroJS this is possible with `sequence()`.

   ::: code-group
   ```js [src/middleware.js]
    import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

    async function validation(_, next) {
        console.log("validation request");
        const response = await next();
        console.log("validation response");
        return response;
    }

    async function auth(_, next) {
        console.log("auth request");
        const response = await next();
        console.log("auth response");
        return response;
    }

    async function greeting(_, next) {
        console.log("greeting request");
        const response = await next();
        console.log("greeting response");
        return response;
    }

    export const onRequest = sequence(validation, auth, greeting);
   ```

5. ### Environment Variables
   Astro uses Vite's built-in support for environment variables what means that the environment variables are statically replaced at build time. 

   In AstroJS it's important to know that *all* environment variables are available in server-side code. And only the environment variables prefixed with `PUBLIC_` are available in client-side code. 
   
   ::: code-group
   ```[.env]
   SECRET_PASSWORD=password123
   PUBLIC_ANYBODY=there
   ```
   :::

   In this example, `PUBLIC_ANYBODY` (accessible via `import.meta.env.PUBLIC_ANYBODY`) will be available in server or client code, while `SECRET_PASSWORD` (accessible via `import.meta.env.SECRET_PASSWORD`) will be server-side only.

   <br>

   #### Default environment variables

   In AstroJS there are a few environment variables build-in.

   - `import.meta.env.MODE`: The mode your AstroJS application is running is.

      Example: `development` or `production`

   - `import.meta.env.PROD`: Is `true` when the AstroJS application is running in *production*. `false` if not.
   - `import.meta.env.DEV`: Is `true` when the AstroJS application is running in *development*. `false` if not. 
   - `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`: The base url of your AstroJS application.
   
      Example: `/`

   - `import.meta.env.SITE`: The full URL of the website where your AstroJS application is hosted.
   
      Example: `https://www.example.com`
      
   - `import.meta.env.ASSETS_PREFIX`: The URL prefix used for loading static assets (e.g., images, scripts).
   
      Example: `/assets/` or `https://cdn.example.com/`
   
    <br>

   #### Usage
   Environment variables in AstroJS are accessed with `import.meta.env`.

   For example, use `import.meta.env.SECRET_PASSWORD` to get the `SECRET_PASSWORD` environment variable.

   ```js
    const secretPassword = import.meta.env.SECRET_PASSWORD;
    const isProd = import.meta.env.PROD;
    const isDev = import.meta.env.DEV;
   ```

6. ### UI Integrations

   AstroJS makes it very easy to add additional functionalities and behaviors. 

   Styling frameworks like Tailwind and
